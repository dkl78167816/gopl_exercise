《Go语言圣经》/《Go程序设计语言》练习题个人解答

Personal solution of exercises in《The Go Programming Language》

## GUIDE

I organize the code with go mod. So after downloading the code, you need to use the whole folder as workspace,
otherwise there may be dependency errors.

Each chapter has own folder, and each exercise in chapter folder has a folder too.
Non exercise folders exist as packages imported by exercises, eg. `ch2/tempconv`.
